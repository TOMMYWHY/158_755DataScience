    "Programming is the craft of writing very specific instructions which the computer can understand and execute in order to carry out certain tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections of these instructions are called computer programs, software or scripts depending on their size, format and complexity. In essence, all these instructions are simply collections of recipes describing the step-by-step process for implementing a given functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, computers work only on the basis of zeros and ones and therefore do not understand natural language. Since programming in zeros and ones is too hard for us, we have invented programming languages to simplify things for us. Programming languages help to bridge this gap. Computers still do not understand source code which is written in programming languages, but instead rely on very special programs called compilers and interpreters which transform source code written by us, into executable instructions which computers can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages come in many different flavours. There are thousands of them. Each one has strengths and weaknesses and is better suited for some domains and problems. All of them have a very precise syntax and set of grammar rules that must be strictly followed. \n",

Apart from being an ideal language for learning programming due its expressive power, it is widely used in the analytics domain both in industry and academia, having extensive support for performing data processing, cleaning, acquisition, transformation, analysis as well as data mining and machine learning. For this reason, Python will be used as the main programming language for this course.\n",
